Initially created the wrong answer for #1 - Your feedback was: I saw you added an addNumbers function but didn't call it, what you had var sum = (874, 35) isn't actually valid javascript (you forgot to call the function name there)
despite it not being the correct answer to the question, does this fix that?

function addNumbers (num1, num2) {
  var result = num1 + num2;
  return(result)
}

var addNumbers = (874, 35)

// #2 //
var cities = ["Los Angeles", " New York City", "Chicago";]
var name = cities[0]
cities[0]
cities[2]
cities[1]

var registration = {firstName: "Brett", lastName: "Balco", Age: 30};
alert(registration.firstName);
console.log("Hello, " + registration.firstName);
